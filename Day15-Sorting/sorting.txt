Q- What is sorting?
Ans- Permutating a sequence to enforce the order.


Q-What is absolute bruteforce of soring?
ans- To calculate all permutations and check the order.
     Timecomplexity:O(N!N)
    
We will see these terms in this lecture
1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity
3. No. of Comparisions
4. No. of swaps
5. Stability
6.Inplace

Q. What is Time Complexity?
Ans. Time complexity = O(No.of swaps +No.of comparisions+Space Complexity).

So We will see why no.of comparisions and no of swaps are important for some usage.

Q-What is stability?
Ans: If two objects are equal according to some key that we are using for comparision then they must retain their original relative order .

Q-Lets say we have given a ship with full of container with different height and we want to sort the containers on the ship.

Ans: Inorder to archieve the solution we alway want a algorithm that will take minimum swaps and can take any numbers of comparisions.
