Q1. What is Tree?
Ans: 1. Tree are the hierarchy data structure.
     2. Parent child kind of structure.
     3. It is collection of node and list of references of its next node or child node.
     4.The root which do not have any parent called root node.
     5.And those nodes do not have childrens are called leaf nodes of the tree.


Q. What are the applications of Tree?
Ans. 1. Git Branching.
     2. file System.
     3. Decision Tree.
     4. Document Object Model (DOM) , every tag is treated as tree node in HTML.
     5. DBMS use tree , in indexing(B-tree) .


Q. What are the types of Tree?
Ans. We divided based on numbers of children.
    1. Degerated Tree (Parent can have at max one child).
    2. Binary Tree (Parent can have at max 2 children).
    3. Ternary Tree (Parent can have at max 3 children).
    4. quaternary Tree (Parent can have at max 4 children).
    5. N-ary Tree (Parent can have n number of children) or we call it generic tree.
    6. Skewed Tree (Parent can have at max one child but in a 1 direction either left or right).

Q. What are the Traversal Tree?
Ans. The way of read the corresponding data.
    Types of Traversal order in Binary Tree.
    1. Preorder
    2. Inorder
    3. Postorder
    4. Level order
1. Preorder: It says, first I will read the node and after that read the left sub-tree completely and then i will read right sub-tree completely recursively.

2. Inorder: It says, first I will read the left sub-tree completely and then read the node and after that then i will read right sub-tree completely recursively.

3. Postorder: It says, first read the left sub-tree completely and then read right sub-tree completely and then will read the node and after that recursively.

4. Level order : It says, From the root the depth of a node and depth of same level node will print.
