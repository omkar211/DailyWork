There are N (N > 0) beggars sitting in a row outside a temple. Each beggar initially has an empty pot. When the devotees come to the temple, they donate some amount of coins to these beggars. Each devotee gives a fixed amount of coin(according to his faith and ability) to some K beggars sitting next to each other.

Given the amount donated by each devotee to the beggars ranging from i to j index, where 1 <= i <= j <= N, find out the final amount of money in each beggar's pot at the end of the day, provided they don't fill their pots by any other means.

Example:

Input:
N = 5, D = [[1, 2, 10], [2, 3, 20], [2, 5, 25]]

Return: [10, 55, 45, 25, 25]

Explanation:
=> First devotee donated 10 coins to beggars ranging from 1 to 2. Final amount in each beggars pot after first devotee: [10, 10, 0, 0, 0]

=> Second devotee donated 20 coins to beggars ranging from 2 to 3. Final amount in each beggars pot after second devotee: [10, 30, 20, 0, 0]
=> Third devotee donated 25 coins to beggars ranging from 2 to 5. Final amount in each beggars pot after third devotee: [10, 55, 45, 25, 25]


solution 1:- so here is N is Number of beggers and D is donation information for beggers.
            so first take the array of size N and assign default value to zero.
            and ask every Donator From D to donate the money and run a loop from index i to index j
            i) Code :-
                def find_money_begger(N,D):
                    res=[0]*(N-1)
                    for i in range(len):
                        for j in range(D[i][0]-1,D[i][1],1):
                            res[j]+=D[i][2]
                    return res
            Time Compexity : O(n2)
            Space Complexity : O(n)

solution2 : we can use the given information for every donar donates the money in their given index
            so lets say donar start donate money from index "i" till index "j" such "x" amount 
            if i add amount at index "i" and set flag that we have to donate till jth index .
            after that i have to remove "x" amount from j+1 to nth index. so here i will add up "-x" amount
            at "j+1" index.
            after the all donation completion. i have to just calculate the prefix sum of array that will be my answer.
            i) Code is here:-
                        def find_money_begger(N,D):
                            #create a list of size N to store the money for beggers
                            res=[0]*(N-1)
                            for i in range(len(D)):
                                res[D[i][0]-1]+=D[i][2]
                                res[D[j][1]]+=-1*D[i][2]
                            for i in range(1,N):
                                res[i]+=res[i-1]
                            return res
