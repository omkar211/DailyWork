Q:- What is the time complecity of a dynamic array?
Ans:- Inorder to calculate worst time complexity that would be O(n).
this is because of lets say cells of the array are full but we need to insert a element in a array. in that case we have to allocate the array and put all the previous array values in new created one and 
      Amotized complexity is O(1)
