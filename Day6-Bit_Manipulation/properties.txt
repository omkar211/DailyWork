if we added up with condition result will following like: 
           
A   B  AND    OR   XOR
0   0   0     0    0
0   1   0     1    1
1   0   0     1    1
1   1   1     1    0

1.if We use << left shifter
   M<<N ==> it means we added N number or ZEROS at the starting of M bits and REMOVE N bits from end.
   M=M*2^N
2.If we use >> right shifter
  M>>N ==> it means we remove N bits from starting of M and added N bits in back.
  means M/2^N  
3. (N&N-1) unset the last bit.
4. Xor property 
   A^A=0
   A^0=A
   A^B=C=>A=B^C
